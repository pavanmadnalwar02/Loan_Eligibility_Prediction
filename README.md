# Loan Eligibility Prediction Using Machine Learning 🚀
## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict loan eligibility for applicants based on financial and demographic factors. Using Machine Learning, we automate the loan approval process, helping banks make data-driven decisions while reducing risks.

## 📂 Dataset & Features
The dataset contains applicant details, including:
Demographics: Gender, Marital Status, Dependents
Financial Information: Applicant Income, Loan Amount, Credit History
Loan Details: Loan Term, Property Area, Employment Type
## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
Python: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Power BI
Notebook: Jupyter Notebook
## 📊 Approach
✅ Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, performed feature encoding, and normalized numerical data.
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified key factors affecting loan approval.
✅ Model Training & Evaluation:
    Tested multiple models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost).
    Random Forest achieved 82% accuracy, making it the best performer.
✅ Business Impact: Automated loan approvals, minimized risk, and optimized decision-making.
